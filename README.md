# ATM
This is the first "major" thing that I have created using python. I have used python concepts like conditionals, funcitons and classses in it.
So it's basically an ATM where you can credit and debit money from your bank account you can even check your balance, All by entering your account number and account password.
It is (for now) only capable to have one account details though.
however, in future, feature of adding and handling multiple accounts will be added.
